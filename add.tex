Different software solutions have been developed for the calculation and implementation of Ambisonics decoding matrices. The present paper presents and describes a new data file format which can be used as an intermediate between solutions.

Currently available software solutions use particular data conventions causing difficult compatibility and exchangeability. In the present work an open-source toolkit is developed for storing, handling and using Ambisonics decoding matrices. The toolkit includes tools for conversion from common matrix data conventions to the ADD-format and back, calculating decoding matrices, decoding Ambisonics signals and extracting existing matrices from external decoding tools. 

The new ADD-format and toolkit enables increased flexibility in production workflows and eliminates the drawbacks and limitations regarding compatibility between software solutions.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Ambisonics}

Ambisonics is a 3D audio representation approach based on spherical harmonics. Compared to traditional multichannel audio where each channel contains the signal for one loudspeaker, in Ambisonics the channels contain information about certain properties of the acoustic field.

It was first developed in the 1970s by the British National Research Development Corporation for Broadcasting purposes.\citationneeded Recently the format has found new popularity as higher order implementations in virtual reality applications and special mutlichannel setups.

\section{Ambisonics Encoding/Decoding} \label{sec:AmbisonicsEncodingDecoding}

\subsection{Normalization}

For succesful reconstruction of the sound field encoding and decoding have to agree on the method by which the spherical harmonic compononents are normalized. There are different approaches to calculating the normalization factor $N$ of ambisonics channel $m$ with order $\ell$ . In the following the most common ones are described.

\subsubsection{SN3D}

With SN3D or Schmidt semi-normalisation no component will ever exceed the peak vlaue of the 0th order component for single point sources. \autocite{ambix} Since the proposal of the AmbiX format it has been widely adopted in modern ambisonics software development.

\[
    N_{\ell,m}^{SN3D} = \sqrt{(2-\delta_m)\cfrac{\ell-|m|!}{\ell+|m|!}},\delta_m 
    \begin{cases} 
    1 & \quad \text{if m = 0}\\
    1 & \quad \text{if m $\neq$ 0}
    
    \end{cases}
\]

\subsubsection{N3D}

N3D differs from SN3D only by a scaling factor. It esnures qual power of the encoded components in the case of a perfectly diffuse 3D field.\autocite{daniel} It is used in MPEG-H.

\[
    N_{\ell, m}^{\mathrm{N} 3 \mathrm{D}}=N_{\ell, m}^{\mathrm{SN} 3 \mathrm{D}} \sqrt{2 \ell+1}    
\]
